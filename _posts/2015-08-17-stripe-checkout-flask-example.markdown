Example from [here](https://gist.github.com/maccman/3299715) 

Very clean example with Python / Flask

Just 37 lines (service)
and three views: index, charge and a layout.

If we added some css styles, e.g. Twitter Bootstrap, 
then it could already run as a single page shop.

Then the next question is about:

1.  Customer Managment Backend

2. Inventory / Logistics (if the product is physical)
