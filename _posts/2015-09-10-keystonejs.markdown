[KeystoneJS](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone)

Almost every applications need CRUD operations.

To save time, coding the same things like

mongoose, routes, schema, GET/POST/PUT/DELETE,

we should have something help us do it automatically.

KeystoneJS is very actively developing, it could be an essential tool just like express or mongoose.

Only one thing I'd like to change is the traditional table view,

if we could use card to display each item, 

it looks more beautiful, especially when there is an image.
