[KeystoneJS](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone)

Almost every applications need CRUD operations.

To save time, coding the same things like

mongoose, routes, schema, GET/POST/PUT/DELETE,

we should have something help us do it automatically.

KeystoneJS is very actively developing, it could be an essential tool just like express or mongoose.
